## Final rule (simple)

| Function    | 1D       | 2D | 3D+ (batches/tensors) |
| ----------- | -------- | -- | --------------------- |
| `np.dot`    | ✅        | ✅  | ❌ does NOT work       |
| `@`         | ❌ for 1D | ✅  | ✅ works               |
| `np.matmul` | ❌ for 1D | ✅  | ✅ works               |

## Why `dot` fails in 3D

Because `np.dot` was designed **before deep learning existed**, so it only knows how to do:

* **vector dot product** (1D)
* **matrix multiplication** (2D)

It does **not know** how to loop over a batch of matrices (3D or more).

But `matmul` and `@` DO know how to do that — they handle **batch dimensions** automatically.



## Code to show clearly

```python
# WORKS ✅
np.matmul((3,2,3), (3,3,2))  → (3,2,2)

# FAILS ❌
np.dot((3,2,3), (3,3,2))  → ERROR
```

## In one sentence

> `np.dot` works for **2 dimensions only**,
> `@` and `matmul` work for **2D AND 3D+ tensors**.
