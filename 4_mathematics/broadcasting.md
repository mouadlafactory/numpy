# 🔍 The arrays involved

| Shape   | Description        | Example         |
| ------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| `(3,)`  | row-like vector    | `[1, 2, 3]`     |
| `(3,1)` | column-like vector | `[[1],[2],[3]]` |

---

# ✅ Step 1: Shapes before broadcasting

```
(3,)     = [1 2 3]         (treated as (1×3))
(3,1)    = [[1]
           [2]
           [3]]           (a 3×1 column)
```

---

# ✅ Step 2: Broadcasting tries to match dimensions

Matrix-like view:

```
(1×3)
[1 2 3]

(3×1)
[1]
[2]
[3]
```

NumPy expands both arrays to match each other:

| First array `(3,)` expands vertically        | Second array `(3,1)` expands horizontally                |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| becomes `(3×3)` by repeating its row 3 times | becomes `(3×3)` by repeating each value across 3 columns |

---

# ✅ Step 3: Expanded arrays

### Expanded row vector (broadcasted vertically):

```
[1 2 3]
[1 2 3]
[1 2 3]
```

### Expanded column vector (broadcasted horizontally):

```
[1 1 1]
[2 2 2]
[3 3 3]
```

---

# ✅ Step 4: Element-wise multiplication

Now NumPy multiplies them **element-by-element**:

```
[1*1  2*1  3*1]   -> [1 2 3]
[1*2  2*2  3*2]   -> [2 4 6]
[1*3  2*3  3*3]   -> [3 6 9]
```

---

# ✅ Final result

```
[[1 2 3]
 [2 4 6]
 [3 6 9]]
```

And the final shape is **(3,3)**.

# ❓ Why NOT (1×1)?

Because:

| Operation type     | Result size                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `*` (element-wise) | preserves broadcasted size (3×3) ✅ |
| `np.outer(a,b)`    | (3×3) ✅                            |
| `np.matmul` or `@` | would fail ❌                       |
| `np.dot(a,b)`      | would fail ❌                       |

You only get (1×1) with **dot product of two 1D vectors**:

```python
np.dot([1,2,3], [1,2,3])  # → 1*1 + 2*2 + 3*3 = 14
```

But here, we **don’t** have two 1D vectors — one is `(3,)`, the other is `(3,1)`.

## ✅ Summary in one sentence

> Broadcasting turns one vector into 3 rows and the other into 3 columns, producing a full (3×3) outer product matrix.
